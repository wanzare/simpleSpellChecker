The history of the Internet serves as an inspiration on how much value can be created when building systems on top of open and neutral protocols but also as a warning that centralizing trust and power in a small number of organizations might turn into an existential threat to the democratic foundations of our society.
To address this dilemma and return to a more balanced trust model, we need to develop tools that help to reduce dependencies on trusted intermediaries and spread power more widely, that facilitate collaboration between mutually distrustful parties in a scalable way, and that protect the privacy of involved participants. Getting there is by no means trivial, however, due to a vast number of challenges we face in the design and development of these technologies.
